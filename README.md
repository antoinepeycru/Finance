Advanced CAPM Analysis Tool
This project provides a comprehensive tool for estimating the Capital Asset Pricing Model parameters using real-world financial data. By analyzing the relationship between individual equity returns and broader market movements, the script quantifies the systematic risk and risk-adjusted performance of various stocks. It leverages the Yahoo Finance API to gather historical price data for specific tickers, the S&P 500 index as a market proxy, and the 13-week Treasury Bill to establish a daily risk-free rate.

The core logic of the application revolves around calculating daily excess returns and performing an Ordinary Least Squares regression. By subtracting the risk-free rate from both the stock and market returns, the model isolates the true premium earned for taking on market risk. The script uses the statsmodels library to solve the CAPM equation, extracting the Beta coefficient to measure market sensitivity and the Alpha intercept to determine performance beyond what is explained by the market.

The output is designed for analytical depth, producing a detailed summary report and regression statistics for each ticker. These results allow for a nuanced interpretation of different investment profiles, such as identifying high-beta aggressive stocks or low-correlation defensive assets. Furthermore, the inclusion of R-squared and p-value metrics provides a statistical foundation to evaluate how much of a stock's movement is truly driven by the market and whether the observed Alpha is statistically significant.

From a technical standpoint, the project demonstrates advanced data handling techniques including time-series alignment and the use of position-based indexing to manage complex ticker symbols. It emphasizes robustness in financial computing by transforming annual yields into daily compounding rates and ensuring data integrity through automated cleaning and gap-filling. This makes the tool a practical bridge between theoretical finance and automated Python-based analysis.
